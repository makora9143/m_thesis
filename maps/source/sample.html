The KNU (Karen National Union) has changed its demands from independence to propagating federalism and autonomy for ethnic minorities. Intense conflict in the 1980s and 1990s, and KNU defections, forced the KNU to abandon its strongholds but occasional fighting continued in the hills near the Thai border. In late 2011, the Democratic Karen Benevolent Army 5 (DKBA 5) agreed to a ceasefire, which was quickly followed by a ceasefire agreement being reached between the KNU and the government on 12 January 2012.</p>","year":{"1949":3000,"1950":5000,"1951":999,"1952":999,"1953":999,"1954":999,"1955":999,"1956":999,"1957":999,"1958":999,"1959":999,"1960":999,"1961":999,"1962":999,"1963":999,"1964":999,"1965":999,"1966":999,"1967":999,"1968":999,"1969":999,"1970":999,"1971":999,"1972":999,"1973":999,"1974":999,"1975":999,"1976":999,"1977":999,"1978":999,"1979":999,"1980":999,"1981":999,"1982":999,"1983":999,"1984":999,"1985":999,"1986":999,"1987":999,"1988":7000,"1989":999,"1990":999,"1991":999,"1992":9999,"1995":999,"1997":200,"1998":999,"1999":999,"2000":225,"2001":999,"2002":120,"2003":37,"2005":46,"2006":265,"2007":407,"2008":100},"sum":{"1949":3000,"1950":8000,"1951":8999,"1952":9998,"1953":10997,"1954":11996,"1955":12995,"1956":13994,"1957":14993,"1958":15992,"1959":16991,"1960":17990,"1961":18989,"1962":19988,"1963":20987,"1964":21986,"1965":22985,"1966":23984,"1967":24983,"1968":25982,"1969":26981,"1970":27980,"1971":28979,"1972":29978,"1973":30977,"1974":31976,"1975":32975,"1976":33974,"1977":34973,"1978":35972,"1979":36971,"1980":37970,"1981":38969,"1982":39968,"1983":40967,"1984":41966,"1985":42965,"1986":43964,"1987":44963,"1988":51963,"1989":52962,"1990":53961,"1991":54960,"1992":64959,"1993":64959,"1994":64959,"1995":65958,"1996":65958,"1997":66158,"1998":67157,"1999":68156,"2000":68381,"2001":69380,"2002":69500,"2003":69537,"2004":69537,"2005":69583,"2006":69848,"2007":70255,"2008":70355,"2009":70355,"2010":70355,"2011":70355},"active":{"1948":0,"1949":1,"1950":1,"1951":1,"1952":1,"1953":1,"1954":1,"1955":1,"1956":1,"1957":1,"1958":1,"1959":1,"1960":1,"1961":1,"1962":1,"1963":1,"1964":1,"1965":1,"1966":1,"1967":1,"1968":1,"1969":1,"1970":1,"1971":1,"1972":1,"1973":1,"1974":1,"1975":1,"1976":1,"1977":1,"1978":1,"1979":1,"1980":1,"1981":1,"1982":1,"1983":1,"1984":1,"1985":1,"1986":1,"1987":1,"1988":1,"1989":1,"1990":1,"1991":1,"1992":1,"1993":1,"1994":1,"1995":1,"1996":1,"1997":1,"1998":1,"1999":1,"2000":1,"2001":1,"2002":1,"2003":1,"2004":1,"2005":1,"2006":1,"2007":1,"2008":1,"2009":1,"2010":1,"2011":1},"year_start":"1948","year_end":null},{"id":21,"country_id":"MMR","region_no":5,"name":"Karenni","scale":0.6,"lat":19.262,"lon":97.27,"body":"<label>Active Dates</label><h3>1948 - Present (2012)</h3><p>The territorial conflict over the Karenni region dates back to 1957, when KNPP (Karenni National Progressive Party) was formed with the aim to establish a sovereign Karenni state.

The LTTE’s struggle went beyond reversal of discrimination by the Sinhala dominated Sri Lankan government to a goal of an independent Tamil state of Eelam in the north and east of Sri Lanka. Despite attempts to solve the conflict through negotiations, little progress was made over three decades.  In 2009, the conflict ended through a decisive victory of the government forces over the LTTE (Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam).</p>","year":{"1984":4000,"1985":4000,"1986":4000,"1987":4000,"1988":3200,"1989":5150,"1990":4800,"1991":7100,"1992":4800,"1993":2400,"1994":1700,"1995":5900,"1996":3600,"1997":4800,"1998":4800,"1999":4100,"2000":4800,"2001":4800,"2003":59,"2005":300,"2006":4126,"2007":4500,"2008":11144},"sum":{"1984":4000,"1985":8000,"1986":12000,"1987":16000,"1988":19200,"1989":24350,"1990":29150,"1991":36250,"1992":41050,"1993":43450,"1994":45150,"1995":51050,"1996":54650,"1997":59450,"1998":64250,"1999":68350,"2000":73150,"2001":77950,"2002":77950,"2003":78009,"2004":78009,"2005":78309,"2006":82435,"2007":86935,"2008":98079,"2009":98079,"2010":98079,"2011":98079},"active":{"1976":0,"1977":1,"1978":1,"1979":1,"1980":1,"1981":1,"1982":1,"1983":1,"1984":1,"1985":1,"1986":1,"1987":1,"1988":1,"1989":1,"1990":1,"1991":1,"1992":1,"1993":1,"1994":1,"1995":1,"1996":1,"1997":1,"1998":1,"1999":1,"2000":1,"2001":1,"2002":1,"2003":1,"2004":1,"2005":1,"2006":1,"2007":1,"2008":1,"2009":2},"year_start":"1976","year_end":"2009"},{"id":35,"country_id":"THA","region_no":0,"name":"Thailand","scale":0.9,"lat":0.0,"lon":0.0,"body":"<label>Active Dates</label><h3>1902 - Present (2012)</h3><p>The southernmost provinces of Thailand, also known as the Deep South, have been affected by subnational conflict for more than a century.

During the 19th century, Thai bureaucratic structures were introduced throughout the region leading to resistance from the local Malay elites. The Thai state undertook efforts to reduce the influence of Islamic law, and divided the Patani region into three areas, Pattani, Yala, and Narathiwat, all of which were placed under the direct control of the Ministry of the Interior. A modernization program was also initiated to enforce uniformity in language and culture. After World War II, as the state grew more authoritarian, conformist pressures on the local population of Southern Thailand only increased.  From the 1960s onward, Pattani, Yala, and Narathiwat were a source of quiet resistance and simmering resentment.
